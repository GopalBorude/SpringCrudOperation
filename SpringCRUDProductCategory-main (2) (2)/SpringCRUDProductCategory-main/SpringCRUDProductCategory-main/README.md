 *  **Spring Boot CRUD Operations**
 *  This project is a Spring Boot application that implements CRUD operations for managing categories and products. It includes a one-to-many relationship where each category can have multiple             products. The application uses JPA and Hibernate for database interactions, and pagination is implemented for fetching lists of categories and products. Additionally, when retrieving a       
       single product, the API provides the associated category details. The application follows RESTful principles and is designed with annotation-based configuration.
